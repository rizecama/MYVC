<span class="blueheads">IMPORTANT – Once you are awarded jobs: <br />
</span><br />
 Your referral fee is due immediately upon award. As a courtesy, we provide a 5-day grace period to pay in full by mean of:
<ol style=" padding:5px 0 15px 35px; ">
<li>ACH</li>
<li>Check</li>
</ol>

A 3rd option is to pledge your receivables due from the association for the awarded work, for our fee portion only.
This option carries an 18% annualized finance fee in addition to your referral fee. This option reduces your cashflow risks;<br />
<strong> we only get paid when you get paid.</strong><br />
<br />


If after the grace period payment is not received in full, option 3 will be required to avoid account termination. To set up your referral payment preference, please go to <span class="greenlinks"><a href="#">My Billing Center.</a></span></div>
