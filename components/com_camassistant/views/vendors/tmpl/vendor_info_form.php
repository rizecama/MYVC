<li><span>VENDOR SCREENING.</span> When a Vendor applies for membership, CAMassistant.com takes basic steps to ascertain the credentials of the Vendor. Steps may include, but will not necessarily include or be limited to, criminal checks, identity verification, sexual predator checks, and state-wide license verifications. All or part of this inquiry may be carried out by a third-party, and may rely partially or entirely on third-party data and data sources. The procedure may change from time to time, at the sole discretion of CAMassistant. CAMassistant.com has no obligation whatsoever to conduct such inquiry, to confirm the accuracy of any data provided to it by third-party sources, or to undertake any independent investigation. You understand that CAMassistant.com does not provide any guarantee, warrantee, endorsement, recommendation, or representation regarding the qualifications, credentials, reputation, license status, insurance status, financial status, bonding information, corporate status, safety record, discipline record, litigation record, or integrity of any Vendor. You agree and understand that the process is not error free, does not constitute a detailed background check, and is extremely limited in scope. You understand that, even if steps to ascertain the credentials of Vendors are taken at the time a Vendor registers with CAMassistant.com, the status of the Vendor may change over time. In addition, CAMassistant.com relies to some degree on the representations of the Vendors themselves. You agree and acknowledge that CAMassistant.com has a right to rely on such information without independently verifying the same and without incurring any liability. Consequently, you understand and agree that it is solely your responsibility to research, ascertain, confirm and verify the license requirements, license status, qualifications, safety record, disciplinary record, insurance status, corporate status, bonding information, integrity, and other qualifications of a Vendor. Determining whether a Vendor is properly licensed to perform a specific task within a specific locality can be a complex task, and you should consult with the appropriate state agency, the county and local building departments, and other license authorities when making such a determination. In addition, you should ask for a copy of the license prior to entering into contract. <u>CAMassistant.com provides no warranties related to the Vendor screening process, including, but not limited to, express or implied warranties, warranties of fitness for a particular purpose, warranties of merchantability, and all other representations and warranties of any type. To use the website, you agree to release CAMassistant.com from any and all liability, and you specifically agree to be responsible for ascertaining and verifying the credentials and current status of vendors.</u></li>
