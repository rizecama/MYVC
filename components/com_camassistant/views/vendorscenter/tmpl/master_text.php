<p>Your company has the ability to create a Preferred Vendor code for your business or property(ies) that Vendors can redeem to be automatically listed on your Corporate Preferred Vendor list. Upon set up of your code, you'll have the option to make it free, cost a one-time fee, or require a reoccurring, automated payment (i.e. annual) for your Vendors to redeem. If you decide to charge your Vendors to redeem your Preferred Vendor code, we do have a 5% fee (per redemption) to cover PayPal and administrative costs. Also, please be aware that other than making your code free, we do not allow you to choose anything below $25 as our standard 5% surcharge would not cover PayPal's single transaction fees<br /><br />
Once a Vendor redeems your Preferred Vendor code, they will be automatically added to your Corporate Preferred Vendor list.  This alleviates you from having to maintain your own list manually. Keeping a well-managed Corporate Preferred Vendor list ensures that all of your Vendors’ contact information, ratings, profile links, and compliance statuses are front and center for you and your staff (if applicable) when looking to qualify Vendors and hire them for new projects.<br /><br />
To create a new Preferred Vendor Code now, click the "CREATE NEW CODE" button. Once you set up your code, it will appear under "PREFERRED VENDOR CODES" and you may begin to distribute your code to Vendors for redemption within their own MyVendorCenter account. Once a Vendor redeems a code, and makes payment (if applicable), they will be listed under the code redeemed along with the amount paid. The total amount you earn from a code will also be listed, based on the number of redemptions and renewals, and can be easily requested by clicking on "REQUEST MONEY". Once your earnings request is submitted to MyVendorCenter, a check will be distributed to you for the total balance in 7-14 business days, minus a 5% surcharge for PayPal and administrative costs.<br /><br />

If you have any further questions or technical issues with this feature, please contact us at  <a href="mailto:support@myvendorcenter.com"><strong>support@myvendorcenter.com</strong></a> or through our online LIVE CHAT.
