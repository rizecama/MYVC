This folder is for all non-Joomla assets. This also includes the global CSS/JS files that we'll be using to avoid redundancy between Joomla templates.

Folders:
	/images/ - Contains non-user, non-Joomla images.
	/css/ - DO NOT EDIT FILES IN THIS FOLDER MANUALLY. You should compile Sass files into this folder.
	/scss/ - Contains Sass files to be compiled into the new CSS. Visit http://sass-lang.com/ for more info.
	/js/ - Contains new JS files for the site. main.js should be modified, app.js should not.
	/static/ - For static files (HTML).
